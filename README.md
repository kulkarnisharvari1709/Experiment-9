# Experiment-9

Program 1: Pointer Arithmetic with Arrays
Aim:
To demonstrate the use of pointers for accessing and traversing elements of an array using pointer arithmetic.

Apparatus / Software:
C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC)

Text Editor or IDE (e.g., Code::Blocks, Dev C++, Visual Studio)

Algorithm:
Declare and initialize an integer array arr with 3 values.

Declare a pointer ptr and assign it the base address of the array.

Print the first element of the array using *arr.

Use a for loop to:

Print the value at the current pointer location.

Increment the pointer to move to the next array element.

End the program.

Conclusion:
This program effectively demonstrates how pointers can be used to traverse an array. By incrementing the pointer, it accesses consecutive elements in the array. This highlights pointer arithmetic, which is a powerful tool in C++ for working with arrays and memory.

Program 2
Aim:
To understand the basic concept of pointers and demonstrate how they store and access the address and value of a variable.

Apparatus / Software:
C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC)

Text Editor or IDE (e.g., Code::Blocks, Dev C++, Visual Studio)

Algorithm:
Declare an integer variable a and assign it a value.

Declare a pointer variable aptr and store the address of a using the address-of operator &.

Print:

The value of a

The value of aptr (i.e., the address of a)

The dereferenced value of aptr using *aptr

The address of a using &a

End the program.

Conclusion:
This program successfully demonstrates the use of pointers in C++. It shows how a pointer stores the address of a variable and how the dereference operator * is used to access the value stored at that address. It helps build a foundational understanding of memory handling and pointer referencing in C++.
